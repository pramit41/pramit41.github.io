subtitle: Little snippet about me 
---

My name is Pramit Thapa. I am a current software engineer at Fidelity Investments with a passion for emerging technologies in frontend, cloud, and AI. In my free time, I like to go on nature walks with my family, read books, play videogames, watch sports (mostly soccer) and hopefully write more blogs on here. Occasionaly, I play the guitar and like to find new experiences around the city with my friends and colleagues. 
Originally, I was born in the foothills of the Himalayas in the city of Kathmandu, Nepal where I spent the first 14 years of my life before moving to the United States. If you have any questions as to what it was like growing up there, I would be happy to share my experiences. Currently, I live in North Carolina where my parents are also in a driving distance.

### Education
I have a degree in B.S. Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Go Heels!)
