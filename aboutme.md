---

My name is Pramit Thapa. I am a current software engineer at Fidelity Investments with a passion for emerging technologies in frontend, cloud, and AI. In my free time, I like to go on nature walks with my family, read books, play videogames, watch sports (mostly soccer) and hopefully wrtie more blogs on here. Occasionaly, I play the guitar and like to find new experiences around the city with my friends and colleagues. 

### Education
I have a degree in B.S. Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Go Heels!)
